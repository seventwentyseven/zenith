                When connecting to our service from the Seven Twenty Seven game client, a client-specific
                string is submitted to help us identify your current play environment.
                It is created based off a combination of identifiers from your hardware and
                software configuration and hashed in such a way that it contains no personally
                identifiable information, but can be used to track your access across logins
                to our service.
                <br><br>
                The main purpose of this is to maintain a fair ranking system and help us enforce
                account security should your account be accessed from a compromised location.
                This is considered private and only stored as long as it is deemed relevant.
                It is also non-transferable, and has no meaning outside the Seven Twenty Seven ecosystem.
